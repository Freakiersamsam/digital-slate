## Overview

The Digital Slate app now includes a comprehensive authentication and user management system built on Firebase Authentication. This system provides secure user login, profile management, and enhanced collaboration features.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ **Authentication Methods**
- **Email/Password**: Traditional account creation and login
- **Google Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Google accounts
- **Anonymous Authentication**: Guest access with option to upgrade
- **Account Linking**: Convert anonymous sessions to permanent accounts

### ✅ **User Management**
- **User Profiles**: Display name, email, profile pictures
- **Account Settings**: Edit profile information
- **Session Persistence**: Stay logged in across browser sessions
- **Role Management**: Owner/Participant roles in collaborative sessions

### ✅ **Enhanced UI**
- **Header User Button**: Shows current user with avatar/initial
- **Login Modal**: Clean, accessible authentication interface
- **User Profile Modal**: Manage account settings
- **Anonymous User Indicators**: Clear visual cues for guest users

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### New Users
1. **Land on app** → See "Sign In" button in header
2. **Click Sign In** → Modal opens with options:
   - Continue with Google
   - Create account with email
   - Continue as Guest (anonymous)
3. **Choose method** → Account created, immediately signed in
4. **Start using app** → All features available with data persistence

### Anonymous Users
1. **Use app as guest** → All features work, data stored locally
2. **See upgrade prompts** → "Save Your Data" notices
3. **Click user button** → Profile shows "Create Account" option
4. **Link account** → Convert to permanent account, keep all data

### Returning Users
1. **Open app** → Automatically signed in (if previously logged in)
2. **See user button** → Click to view/edit profile
3. **All data synced** → Notes and sessions available across devices

   - Consider more granular permissions as needed

### Environment Variables
All Firebase config is already set up in `.env`:
- ✅ API keys configured
- ✅ Auth domain set
- ✅ Project ID configured
- ✅ Database URL working

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### Test Scenarios
1. **Anonymous Sign-In**:
   - Open app → Should auto-sign in anonymously
   - User button shows anonymous indicator
   - All features work normally

2. **Email Registration**:
   - Click "Sign In" → "Create Account"
   - Enter email/password → Account created
   - Profile shows correct user info

3. **Google Sign-In**:
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - OAuth flow → Signed in with Google account
   - Profile picture and name populated

4. **Account Linking**:
   - Start as anonymous user
   - Click user button → "Create Account & Save Your Data"
   - Link with email or Google → Data preserved

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Authentication flows work
- [ ] User profile displays correctly
- [ ] Data persistence across sessions
- [ ] Anonymous to authenticated upgrade
- [ ] Sign out functionality
- [ ] Error handling for invalid credentials

## 🔄 **Integration with Existing Features**
